Netgen Comments is an eZ Publish extension that builds upon existing
eZ Comments extension adding AJAX commenting capabilities.

It supports all of the features that eZ Comments supports: adding, editing,
deleting comments, recaptcha, turning off unneeded fields etc.

Netgen Comments is technically built on top of eZ Comments, so it requires it.
All the configuration is done in eZ Comments extension, Netgen Comments uses
already available settings and honors them.
